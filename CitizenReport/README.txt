📍 CitizenReport Module

This folder contains the civic reporting logic for multilingual community engagement.

🧭 Purpose:
- To collect, structure, and dispatch civic reports submitted by users
- To support multilingual input and output
- To integrate with badge dispatch and poetic logging

📦 Contents:
- reportForm.html (optional UI scaffold)
- civicReport.js (logic for handling reports)
- translations.json (language-specific civic phrases)

🪶 Philosophy:
Each report is a voice. Each voice deserves clarity, dignity, and dispatch with character.

🔐 Notes:
- All data is processed locally unless explicitly configured for live dispatch
- GDPR and civic ethics must be respected if deployed publicly

🛠️ Next Steps:
- Connect to BadgeDispatch for symbolic feedback
- Integrate with MultilingualCore for language detection
- Log each submission in PoeticLogs with timestamp and tone
